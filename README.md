I. Core Chess Rules 
Piece Movement: All pieces move according to standard chess rules (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
Capturing: Pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square occupied by the opponent's piece.
Check & Checkmate: The objective is to checkmate the opponent's King. A King is in "check" when it is under attack. A player must remove their King from check.
Stalemate: If a player's King is not in check, but the player has no legal moves, the game is a draw (stalemate).
Castling: Castling is allowed under standard chess rules.
En Passant: En passant is allowed under standard chess rules.
Pawn Promotion: Pawns that reach the opposite end of the board are promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight (player's choice).
II. Specific rules
Time Control: This is crucial for a multiplayer game. They need to define how much time each player has for their moves. Examples:
Blitz: Very fast (e.g., 3 minutes per player + 2 seconds increment per move).
Rapid: Faster than classical, but more time (e.g., 10 minutes per player + 5 seconds increment).
Classical: More time (e.g., 30 minutes per player).
Glicko-2 Rating System: A rating system that dynamically adjusts based on player performance.
"SMG" Element - Potential Rule Ideas: The "SMG" part is the most ambiguous. Here are some ideas, keeping in mind the backend needs to verify them:
Piece Power/Stats: Each piece might have a slightly different power level or special ability. This would need to be carefully balanced. (e.g., Knights could have a higher chance of forking, Bishops could have longer-range attacks).
Dynamic Board Changes: The board itself might change during the game. This is a more radical idea. (e.g., certain squares could become temporarily blocked, or pieces could move differently on certain squares).
Special Piece Abilities: Introduce new pieces with unique movement patterns or abilities.
"Vector" Movement: Perhaps pieces can move in a more directional or angled way, not just straight lines. This would require a significant overhaul of the movement rules.
"SMG" Actions: Introduce special actions that players can take, perhaps using a limited resource. (e.g., a "boost" to a piece's movement, a temporary shield for the King).
Draw Conditions: Beyond stalemate, they might define other draw conditions:
Threefold Repetition: The same position occurs three times in the game.
Fifty-Move Rule: Fifty consecutive moves have been made by both players without any pawn movement or capture.
Mutual Agreement: Both players agree to a draw.
Handicaps: Rules for handicapping players of different skill levels. (e.g., giving a weaker player extra time or starting with an extra pawn).
Illegal Move Penalties: What happens if a player makes an illegal move? (e.g., the move is rejected, the player loses a time penalty, the player loses the game).
Game End Conditions: Clearly define what constitutes a win (checkmate) and a loss (resignation, time out, etc.).
Backend Verification: The chat mentions the backend verifying rules. This implies that the backend needs to:
Ensure moves are legal according to the rules.
Track time and enforce time limits.
Detect draw conditions.
Handle illegal moves.
Manage any special abilities or actions.
III. Important Considerations for the Backend
Rule Engine: A robust rule engine is needed to handle all the game logic and ensure that the rules are consistently applied.
Scalability: The backend needs to be able to handle a large number of concurrent games.
Security: The backend needs to be secure to prevent cheating.
User Interface: The backend needs to provide a user interface for players to interact with the game.
Data Storage: The backend needs to store game data (e.g., game state, player moves, time).
